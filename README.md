Recurrent Neural Networks for object detection

Recurrent neural networks have been recently used to detect patterns inside an image as well as patterns in between successive images. This has a big importance, since objects in a scene construct a strong context in autonomous driving domain as well as containing strong links with the objects in the following scenes. In this topic, students are expected to work on recurrent neural network architectures used for object detection in autonomous driving domain.
